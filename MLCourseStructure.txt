What is Regression in Machine Learning?
    The main goal f regression is the construction of an efficient model to predict the dependent attributes from a bunch of attribute variables. A regression problem is when the output variable is either real or a continuous value i.e. salary, weight, area, etc.
    We can also define rgression as a statistical means that is used in applications like housing, investing, etc. It is used to predict the relationship between a dependent value and a bunch of independent variables.
Types of Regression
    Simple Linear Regression
    Polynomial Regression
    Random Forest Regression
    Decision Tree Regression
    Support Vector Regression

Simple Linear Regression: One of the most interesting and common regression technique is simple linear regression. In this, we predict the outcome of a dependent variable based on the independent variables, the relationship between the variables is linear.
Polynomial Regression: In this regression technique, we transform the original features into polynomial features of a given degree and then perform the regression on it.
Support Vector Machine Regression: For the Support Vector Machine Regression or SVR, we identify a hyperplane with maximum margin such that the maximum number of data points are within those margins. It is quite similar to the support vector machine Classification algorithm.
Decision Tree Regression: A decision tree can be used for both regression and classification, we use the ID3 algorithm(Iterative Dichotomiser 3) to identify the splitting the node by reducing the standard deviation.
Random Forest Regression: In Random Forest Regression, we ensemble the predictions of several decision tree regressions.

What is Linear Regression?
    Simple Linear Regression is a regression technique in which the independent variable has a linear relationship with the dependent variable. The straight line in the diagram is the best fit line.
    e.g. Car Resale Value all the factors connect with Price of Car.
    Linear Regression Terminologies
     Cost Function: The cost function provides the best possible values for b0 and b1 to make the best fit line for the data points. We do it by converting this problem into a minimization problem to get the best values of b0 and b1. The error is minimized in this problem between the actual value and the predicted value.
     Y = b0 + b1x +e
     where, Y=Dependent Variables
            b0= Y intercept
            b1 = slope
            x = independent Variables
            e = error

      Gradient Descent: It is a method of updating b0 and b1 values to reduce the MSE. The idea behind this is to keep iterating the b0 and b1 values until we reduce the MSE to the minimum.
      A smaller learning rate takes closer to the minimum, but it takes more time and in case of a larger learning rate. The time taken is sooner but there is a chance to overshoot the minimum value.
      Big Learning Rate
      Small Learning Rate.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Linear Regression
Advantages:
Linear Regression performs exceptionally well for the linearly seperable data.
Easier to implement, interpret and efficient to train.
It handles overfitting well using dimensionally reduction techniques, regularization, and cross-validation.
One more advantage is the extrapolation beyond a specific data set.

Disadvantages:
The assumption of linearly between dependent and independent variables.
It is often quite prone to noise and overfitting.
Linear Regression is quite sensitive to outliers.
It is prone to multicollinearity.

Linear Regression Use Cases

    Risk Analysis
    Housing Applications
    Finance Applications

Logistic Regression : What and Why?

Logistic Regression produces results in a binary format which is used to predict the outcome of a categorical dependent Variable. So, the outcome should be discrete/categrical such as:
0 or 1
Yes or No
True or False 
High and Low

Why not Linear Regression?

Since our value of Y will be between 0 and 1, the linear line has to be clipped at 0 or 1.
With this, our resulting curve can not be formulated into a single formula. Hence, we came up with Logistic.

Logistic Regression Curve = The Sigmoid "S" Function Curve
With this, the threshld value indicates the probability of either winning or losing.
The Logistic Regression Equation is derived from the Straight Line Equation.
Equation of Straight Line = y = mx + c 
Range is from -(infinity) to (infinity)

Equation of the straight line = 
Y = C + B1X1 + B2X2 +......... (RANGE IS FROM -(INFINITY) TO (INFINITY))

Let's try to reduce the Logistic Regression Equation from the Straight Line Equation

Y = C + B1X1 + B2X2 + ........ (In Logistic Equation Y can be only from 0 to 1)

Now, to get the range of Y between 0 and infinity, let's transform y
Y/1-Y  = Y = 0 then 0
Y = 1 then infinity
Now, the range is between 0 to infinity
