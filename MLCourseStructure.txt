1.What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. It focuses mainly on the designing of systems. Thereby, allowing them to learn and make predictions based on some experiences which is data in the case of the machine.
2. Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning
AI : A technique which enables machines to mimic human Behaviour.
ML : Subset of AI technique which use statistical methods to enable Machines to imporve with experiences.
DL : Subset of ML which make the computations of multi-layer neural network feasible.
3.How does Machine Learning Work?
Training Data=>Train the ML Algorithm => Model Input Data => New Input Data => ML Algorithm => Prediction
ML model are trained used labeled and unlabeled dataset to produce the successful model. The prediction is evaluated for the accuracy and if the accuracy is acceptable then the Machine Learning Model is deployed. Now if the accuracy of the model is not acceptable then the machine learning model is trained again and again with the augmented training data set.
5. Machine Learning Types: Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement.
Supervised Learning : 
Supervised Learning Algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines
Usecases of Supervised Machine Learning: Cortana,Weather Prediction, Biometric Attendance, Supervised Learning in Bank Predict Credit Wrthiness of Credit Card Holders, Supervised Learning in Healthcare : Predict Patient Readmission Rates, Supervised Learning in Retail Analyse Products Custmers Buy Together.

Unsupervised Learning:
Unsupervised Learning Algorithms: Apriori Algorithm, K-Means Algorithm, Hierarchical Clustering
Usecases of Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised Learning in Bang Segment Customers by Behaviural , Characteristics, Unsupervised Learning in Healthcare Categorize MRI Data by Normal  or Abnormal images. It uses the Deep Learning Technique that learn from model to learn the various information from the various images.
Unsupervised Learning in Retail Recommend Products to Customers on the basis of Past Purchase
Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement Learning is a type of Machine Learning Algorithm which allows software agents and machines to automatically determing the idal behaviour on the basis of a particular Context to Maximize its performance. Reinforcement Learning is about the interaction between Learning Agent and Environment.The envioronment rewards the Learning Agent for the correct actiona and punishes for the wrong action.
Reinforcement Training with Dog: Pablo trained Dog with the Reinforcement Learning.
Reinforcement Usecases: Reinforcement Learning in Bank create "Next Best Offer" Model for the Call Centre. Reinforcement Learning in Healthcare Allocate Scarce Medical Resources to Handel Different ER Cases.
Reinforcement Learning in Retail Reduce Excess Stock with Dynamic Pricing

Who is a Machine Learning (ML) Engineer?
Machine Learning Engineers are sophisticated programmers who develop machines and systems that can learn and apply knowledge without any specific direction.

What does an ML Engineer do?
Machine Learning Engineers are creators f the algorithms that allow a machine to find patterns in its own programming data, teaching it to understand commands and even think for itself.

Skills Needed to Become an ML Engineers

Programming Skills

R : Used for developing Statistical Software and Data Analysis.
Python : Lets you Create, Analyse and Organize large chunks of Data with ease.
Java Programming : Data Description

Probability and Statistics

A Formal Characterization of Probability & Statistics derived from it are at the heart of many Machine Learning Algorithms.
Mean, Median, Variations

Data Modelling and Evaluation

Data Modelling is the process of estimating the underlying structure of a given dataset, with the goal of finding useful patterns and/or predicting properties of previously unseen instances.

Applying Machine Learning Algorithms and Libraries

Standard Implementations of Machine Learning Algorithm are widely available through libraries/packages/APIs.

Software Engineering and System designing

You need to understand how different pieces of the software work together. Communication with them & build appropriate interfaces for your component that others will depend on.
